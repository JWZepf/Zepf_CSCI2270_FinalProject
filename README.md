Project Summary
---------------
This project is an attempt to create a database that will recommend movies for a community of users. Each user will rate movies that they have seen based on a five star scale. It will then compare their ratings with the rest of the users and it will find three other users they are similar too. It will then recommend all the movies that the three similar users have rated 4 or 5 stars that the original user has not rated. The whole database will be concentrated in a class and the user and movie databases will be created using Binary Search Trees.
